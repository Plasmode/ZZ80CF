# ZZ80CF, A Z280 SBC with Compact Flash interface in Z80-Compatible Mode for RC2014
## Introduction
ZZ80CF is an enhanced version of ZZ80RC which is a single-board Z280 computer configured to Z80-bus compatible mode. The enhancement is to add a compact flash interface to the existig form factor of 100mm x 50mm.  It has a RC2014-compatible connector and is designed to interface with RC2014 I/O modules. ZZ80RC is based on through-hole components and the same form factor as a standard RC2014 board.
## Features
